Installing the Isaac Genome Alignment Software
==============================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

- gnuplot (>= 4.0) (required during the execution)
- libnuma (if --with-numa is used)
- libz
- gcc (>= 4.7.3), for compilation
- markdown tool will be used if available to generate html user manual

Building on Linux:
------------

Isaac _must_ be built outside of the source directory. The steps are the usual
configure/make/make install. 

mkdir Isaac-build
cd Isaac-build
/path/to/Isaac/src/configure --prefix=/path/to/Isaac-install
make
make install

For additional options:

/path/to/Isaac/src/configure --help



Building on Windows:
--------------------

Install 64-bit Windows (Windows 7 or higher)
Install Visual Studio 2015
Install Intel C++ Compiler 16.0
Install latest CMake - cmake.org/download

Goto main isaac directory

mkdir Isaac-build
cd Isaac-build
cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -T"Intel C++ Compiler 16.0" -DiSAAC_PREFIX=isaac-install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo /path/to/iSAAC/src
make
make install

For building from within Visual Studio IDE
------------------------------------------
Open iSAAC.sln in Visual Studio
Build from Visual Studio
After Visual Studio build completes, running 'make install' is still required from command line
